An demo of the minimizationc of power comsumption of IoT edge devices inspired by DREAM architecture on CA queue. Update: A draft of ED protocol is written with asusmption of > O(n) tasks.
Current Version: v1.0:
1. Handles one server with multiple clients correctly.
2. Server does a fake process by sleep and reducing work time.
3. Client local workload is not implemented yet, but correctly communicates with
server using socket.
4. Current assumption is works come every 10 seconds with mean of 6.25M as 
DREAM suggests. Additional assumption is delay is fixed at 10s and complexity
is fixed at O(N^2), but it could be changed easily.
TODO:
1. Implement client local workload. Should be just a minute of work.
2. Important: Sleep might not do well when client has huge workload.
Potential fix is switching to posix timer.
