An demo of the minimizationc of power comsumption of IoT edge devices inspired by DREAM architecture. Update: A draft of ED protocol is written with asusmption of > O(n) tasks.
Current Version: v1.0:
1. Handles one server with multiple clients correctly.
2. Server does a fake process by sleep and reducing work time.
3. Client local workload is not implemented yet, but correctly communicates with
server using socket.
TODO:
1. Implement client local workload. Should be just a minute of work.
2. Important: Sleep might not do well when client has huge workload.
Potential fix is switching to posix timer.
